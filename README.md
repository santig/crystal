Crystal
=======================================

### Background

At [weheartit.com](http://weheartit.com) we try to automatize as many repetitive tasks as possible. That's how we started to build Crystal, it acts as a control tower
between the different services we use.

#### Real case scenarios:

Assuming a product feature is associated to a Pivotal Tracker story and Pull Request.

* Once a pull request gets merged/deployed, the PT story gets labeled as "merged" or "deployed".
* When a person accepts a PT story, a green-light to merge comment is posted to the pull request.
* After each deploy, all the deployed stories are labeled as "deployed".
